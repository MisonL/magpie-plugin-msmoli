Thanks for looking at this. Two things worth knowing before changing anything.

## The one rule

**`GET /api/v1/users/login/info` is also the check-in trigger.** ModelScope
grants the day's 魔粒 when it sees that endpoint called. It is therefore not
something the usage read may touch: magpie's menu bar asks for usage every few
minutes, and a usage read that reached it would turn into a check-in request
every few minutes.

The nickname is read there, once, during the check-in, and kept in memory. The
usage hook reads the balance and the ledger only. `test/plugin.test.mjs` asserts
this — the usage test fails if a usage read reaches the sign-in endpoint.

Keep it that way. If you need the account's name in the usage read, take it
from what the check-in already found.

## The second

**Never write the token anywhere.** It lives in magpie's `plugin-auth.json` and
nowhere else. The sign-in method declares neither `prompts` nor `authorize` on
purpose: a prompt's answer lands in `metadata` as well, which puts the same
token on disk twice (see `save()` in magpie's `host.js`).

## Development

```bash
node --test test/          # the suite, no network
node --test test/plugin.test.mjs
```

The tests stub `fetch`; nothing here talks to ModelScope. Fixtures follow the
clock, so they don't expire on a given day.

## Against the real API

If you change the request shapes, check them against a real account — the
endpoints are web APIs, not the documented OpenAPI, and they are not versioned:

```bash
printf 'ms-token\n' | magpie plugin login msmoli
magpie accounts checkin
magpie accounts | grep msmoli
```

## Things that are deliberate

- **A separate `msmoli` provider, with no models.** Chat keeps using the
  `modelscope` preset with your API key. A plugin that served the provider
  inference routes through would take the whole chat path out of magpie when
  its usage window reads as used up.
- **`used` is not capped at 100.** magpie reads a value above 100 as overspent,
  which is what it is.
- **ModelScope's times are parsed as Beijing time.** They carry no zone, and
  `new Date()` would read them in the host's own zone.
